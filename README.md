# custom-MOTD

Greetings,

This script is intended to replace the standard MOTD (Message Of The Day) which appears on my Debian server when I log into the shell. It's an ongoing work in progress as I come up with more potential ideas.

To execute this script, it will need to be placed in the /etc/uodate-motd folder. In my particular instance, I've replaced the script in ./10-uname with this. To fully clear out the stock greeting, I also removed the content of /etc/update-moto.d.

Thanks for reading. Have an amazing day.
